The
company	ARG1
grew
modestly
until
1986
COMMA
when
a
majority
position
in
Hooker	ARG1
Corp.
was
acquired
by
Australian
developer
George
Herscu
COMMA
currently
Hooker

Mr.

proceeded
to
launch
an
ambitious

ill-fated
COMMA
$
1

binge
that
included
Bonwit

For
the
first
time
COMMA
the
83-year-old
justice
finds
his

almost
exclusively
in
dissent

rather

a

in
the
high

Now
COMMA
however
COMMA
as
the
court
's
new
five-member	ARG1
conservative

continues
to
solidify
COMMA
victories
for
the
liberals
are
rare
.

But
a
majority	PRED
of
the
Addison	ARG1
council	PRED
did
n't
buy
those
arguments
.

Mr.
Stram
said
Enron
is
considering
building
gas-fired
power
plants
in
the
U.K.
capable
of
producing
about
500
megawatts	PRED

Most

Controls
COMMA
the
unofficial

the

argue
for
more
liberal
export
rules
at
a
meeting
to
be
held
in
Paris
Oct.

But
the
Bush

says
it
wants
to
see
evidence
that
all
Cocom	ARG1

are
complying
fully
with
existing
export-control
procedures
before
it
will
support
further
liberalization

That
speculation
abounded
Friday
as
industry
executives
analyzed
the
appointment

the
new

COMMA
Robert
Louis-Dreyfus
COMMA
who
joins
Saatchi

becomes
a

Robert

elected

Against

UAW
Vice

COMMA
who

union

GM

COMMA
issued
a

Friday
blasting
GM

``
flagrant

Dissident
UAW

used

labor-management	ARG1
cooperation

failure

Mayor
Lynn
Spruill
and
two

said
they
were
worried
about
setting
a
precedent
that
would
permit
pool
halls
along
Addison

main
street

And
a
safe
one
--
imagine
if
the
romance

an
Orthodox
Jew

In

COMMA
some

John

It
is
also
no

small
New

retailers
when
the
future

larger
department

COMMA

anchor
retail

in

That

less

one-third

Mr.

In

All

COMMA

COMMA
because

To

the

reacted

Meanwhile
COMMA

Of

COMMA
Mr.

Franklin
