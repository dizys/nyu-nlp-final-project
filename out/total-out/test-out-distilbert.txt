Then
in

plunge
,
the
Dow

loss
on

in
gargantuan

In

however
,
the
Dow

was
the
12th-worst
ever

the
sharpest
since
the

8

a

The
Dow	ARG1

The

Mexico
,
which
was
one

countries
to
conclude
its

talks
with

virtually
doubled
its

to
0.95

of
the
U.S.
steel
market	ARG1
from
0.48

under
the
previous

That

rises
to
slightly
more
than
2

of
the
U.S.

if
a
joint
Korean-U.S.

The
EC
steel

has
been
coping
with
strong
European
demand
,
has
been
supplying
about
5

Japan
has

to

about
4.5

In

,
the

had
its

increased
about

to
7

of

6.7

Japan

the

provide
about
80
%
of
the
steel	ARG1
imported
to

U.S.
under
the
quota
program
.

The
U.S.
had
about
an
extra
2
%
of
the
domestic
steel
market	ARG1
to
give
to
foreign
suppliers
in
its
quota
talks
.

That
was
essentially
made
up
of
a
1
%
increase
in
the
overall
quota
program	ARG1
and
1
%
from
cutting
Japan
's

.

Negotiators
from

will
repeat
these
quota
negotiations
next

when
they
will
have
another
1

project
is
included
.

The
EC
steel
industry
,
which
has
been
coping
with
strong
European
demand
,
has
been
supplying
about
5
%
of
the
U.S.
market	ARG1
compared
with
recent
quotas
of
about
6.7
%
.

Japan
has
been
shipping
steel
to
total
about
4.5
%
of
the
U.S.
market	ARG1
compared
with
a
quota
of
5.9
%
.

In
the
recent
talks
,
the
EC
had
its
quota
increased
about
300COMMA000
tons
,
to
7
%
of
the
U.S.
market	ARG1
from
6.7
%
in
1988
.

Japan
,
the
EC
,
Brazil
,
Mexico
and
South
Korea
provide
about
80
%
of
the
steel	ARG1
imported
to
the
U.S.
under
the
quota
program
.

The
U.S.
had
about
an
extra
2
%
of
the
domestic
steel
market	ARG1
to
give
to
foreign
suppliers
in
its
quota
talks
.

That
was
essentially
made
up
of
a
1
%
increase
in
the
overall
quota
program	ARG1
and
1
%
from
cutting
Japan
's
allowance
.

Negotiators
from
the
White
House
trade
office
will
repeat
these
quota
negotiations
next
year
when
they
will
have
another
1
%
of
the
U.S.
steel
market	ARG1
to
allocate
.

In
recent
years
,
U.S.
steelmakers
have
supplied
about
80
%
of
the
100
million
tons	ARG1
of
steel
used
annually
by
the
nation
.

Britain
's

To
be
sure
,
Kao
would
n't
have
an
easy
time
taking
U.S.
market
share
away
from
the
mighty
P&G
,
which
has
about
23
%
of
the

.

The
Cincinnati
consumer-products
giant
got
clobbered
two
years

in
Japan
when
Kao
introduced
a
powerful

,
called

which
quickly
won

Ford

said
it
acquired
5
%
of

The

advised

last

''
said
John
Levinson
,
an
analyst
at

The

that

Meanwhile
,
the
U.S.

negotiated

Unseasonably
hot
,
dry
weather
across
large
portions
of
the
Great
Plains	ARG1
and
in
wheat-growing
areas
in
Washington

is
threatening
to
reduce
the
yield
from

season
's
winter
wheat
crop
,
said
Conrad
Leslie
,
a
futures
analyst
and
head
of
Leslie
Analytical

Chicago
.

And
if
rain
does
n't
fall
soon
across
many
of
the
Great
Plains

wheat-growing	ARG1
areas
,
yields
in
the

Washington
Post
Co.
is
expected
to
report
improved

,
largely
because
of
increased
cable
revenue

publishing
revenue
helped
by
an
improved
retail
market
in
the
Washington
area

A
group
of
Arby

In
the
past
,
the
OTC
market
thrived
on
a
firm
base
of
small-investor
participation	ARG1
.

More
troubling
is
the
prospect
that
the
overall
collapse
in
stock
prices
could
permanently
erode
the
base
of
small-investor
support	ARG1
the
OTC
market
was
struggling
to
rebuild
in
the
wake
of
the
October
1987
crash
.

(
In
a
stock-index
arbitrage
sell
program
,
traders
buy
or
sell
big
baskets
of
stocks	ARG1
and
offset
the
trade
in
futures
to
lock
in
a
price
difference
.
)

The
executives
were
remarkably
unperturbed
by
the
plunge
even
though
it
lopped
billions
of
dollars	ARG1
off
the
value
of
their
companies
--
and
millions
off
their
personal
fortunes
.

The
Bush
administration
,
trying
to
blunt
growing
demands
from
Western
Europe
for
a
relaxation
of
controls
on
exports
to
the
Soviet	ARG1
bloc
,
is
questioning
whether
Italy
's
Ing
.
C.
Olivetti
&
Co.
supplied
militarily
valuable
technology
to
the
Soviets
.

Big
investment
banks
refused
to
step
up
to
the
plate
to
support
the
beleaguered
floor
traders
by
buying
big
blocks
of
stock	ARG1
,
traders
say
.

But
specialists
complain
privately
that
just
as
in
the
1987
crash
,
the
``
upstairs
''
firms
--
big
investment
banks
that
support
the
market
by
trading
big
blocks
of
stock	ARG1
--
stayed
on
the
sidelines
during
Friday
's
blood-letting
.

Meanwhile
,
the
price
of
ethylene
,
the
chemical
building
block
of
polyethylene
,
has
n't
dropped
nearly
so
fast
.

But
grateful
traders
said
the
sell
orders
generally
ranged
from
20COMMA000
shares
to
50COMMA000
shares
,
compared
with
blocks
of
500COMMA000
shares	ARG1
or
more
two
years
ago
.

That
speculation
abounded
Friday
as
industry
executives
analyzed
the
appointment
of
the
new
chief
executive
,
Robert
Louis-Dreyfus
,
who
joins
Saatchi
and
becomes
a
member
of
its
board	ARG1
on
Jan.
1
.

The
executive
said
any
buy-out
would
be
led
by
the
current
board
,
whose
chairman
is
Maurice
Saatchi
and
whose
strategic
guiding
force
is
believed
to
be
Charles
Saatchi
.

Rep.
Panetta
said
that
OMB
's
figure
would
still
be
enough
to
avoid
permanent
across-the-board
cuts
,
but
added
:
``
We
're
getting
very
close
to
the
margins
here
.
''

The
problem
,
which
the
Journal
so
rightly
pointed
out
in
a
number
of
articles	ARG1
,
is
not
the
likes
of
Mr.
Lantos
,
who
after
all
is
really
a
bit
player
on
the
stage
,
but
the
attempt
by
Congress
to
enhance
itself
into
a
quasi-parliamentary/judicial
body
.

``
Now
we
're
at
the
bottom
of
the
heap	ARG1

''

Ever-more
powerful
desk-top
computers
,
designed
with
one
or
more
microprocessors
as
their	ARG1
``
brains
,
''
are
expected
to
increasingly
take
on
functions
carried
out
by
more
expensive
minicomputers
and
mainframes
.

Mr.
Paul
said
the
regulators
should
instead
move
ahead
with
approving
CenTrust
's
request
to
sell
63
of
its	ARG1
71
branches
to
Great
Western
Bank
,
a
unit
of
Great
Western
Financial	ARG1
Corp.
based
in
Beverly
Hills
,
Calif
.

These
``
clean-bank
''
transactions
leave
the
bulk
of
bad
assets	ARG1
,
mostly
real
estate
,
with
the
government
,
to
be
sold
later
.

By
any
``
reasonable
man
''
criterion
,
Mr.
Lantos
and
his
colleagues
have
a
whole
bunch
of
people	ARG1
tried
and
convicted
.

It
focused
on
building
up
its
news
bureaus
around
the
world
,
so
as
events
took
place
it
could
go
live
quicker
and
longer
than
other
networks
.

In
July
,
the
CBOT
ordered
Ferruzzi
Finanziaria
S.p

A.
to
liquidate
futures
positions
equal
to
about
23
million
bushels
of
soybeans	ARG1

By

May
31
,
stocks

the
winter
wheat
now
being
planted
is
harvested
--
are
projected
to
drop
to

That
's
why
it
's
dangerous
to
have
well-intentioned
thought

,
on
college	ARG1

elsewhere

taboo

&
Co.
department
stores
have
filed
for
protection
from
creditors
under
Chapter
11
of
the
federal
Bankruptcy
Code	ARG1
,
while
the
R.H.
Macy
&
Co.
,
Bloomingdale
's
and
Saks
Fifth
Avenue
department-store	ARG1
chains
are
for
sale
.

All
bets
are
off
,
analysts
say
,
because
of
the
shifting
ownership
of
the
retail	ARG1
chains	ARG1
.

A
group
of
Arby
's
franchisees
said
they
formed
an
association
to
oppose
Miami
Beach
financier
Victor
Posner
's
control
of
the
restaurant	ARG1
chain
.

New
York
retail
rents
still
run
well
above
the
going
rate
in
other
U.S.	ARG1
cities
.

Nearly
all
of
the
crude
oil
that
Canada
exports
to
the
U.S.
is
transported
on
Interprovincial
's
system
,
whose
main
line
runs
from
Edmonton
to
major
U.S.
and
Canadian	ARG1
cities
in
the
Great
Lakes
region
,
including
Chicago
,
Buffalo
,
Toronto
and
Montreal
.

Some
500
investors
representing
investor	ARG1
clubs
from
around
the
U.S.
were
attending
when
the
market
started
to
slide
Friday
.

But
Robert
Showalter
,
an
official
of
the
association
,
said
no
special
bulletins
or
emergency
meetings
of
the
investors	ARG1
'
clubs
are
planned
.

Hurricane
Jerry
threatened
to
combine
with
the
highest
tides
of
the
year
to
swamp
the
Texas-Louisiana	ARG1
coast
.

Sanford
Sigoloff
,
chief
executive
of
L.J.
Hooker
,
said
yesterday
in
a
statement
that
he
has
not
yet
seen
the
bid
but
that
he
would
review
it
and
bring
it
to
the
attention
of
the
creditors	ARG1
committee
.

.
That
his
``
committee
does
not
deal
with
any
possible
criminal
activity
at
HUD
.

The
investment	ARG1
community
,
for
one
,
has
been
anticipating
a
speedy
resolution
.

Although
the
legality
of
these
sales
is
still
an
open
question
,
the
disclosure
could
n't
be
better
timed
to
support
the
position
of
export-control
hawks
in
the
Pentagon
and
the
intelligence	ARG1
community
.

The
trend
toward
lower
rents
may
seem
surprising
given
that
some
communities
in
New
York	ARG1
are
bemoaning
the
loss
of
favorite
local
businesses
to
high
rents
.

NCNB
,
for
example
,
has
been
one
of
the
highest
rate
payers
in
the
Texas
market
,
and
in
Florida
,
rates
are
especially
sensitive
in
retirement	ARG1
communities
.

``
This
is
the
latest
manifestation
of
the
capacity
of
the
financial	ARG1
community
for
recurrent
insanity
,
''
says
Mr.
Galbraith
,
an
economist
.

``
It
takes
more
error
now
to
have
a
major
depression
than
back
in
the
Thirties
--
much
as
the
financial	ARG1
community
and
the
government
may
try
.
''

The
exchange
said
it
feared
that
some
members
would
n't
be
able
to
find
enough
soybeans
to
deliver
and
would
have
to
default
on
their
contractual
obligation
to
the
Italian
conglomerate
,
which
had
refused
requests
to
reduce
its
holdings
.

A
consortium
of
private
investors	ARG1
operating
as
LJH
Funding
Co.
said
it
has
made
a
$
409
million
cash
bid
for
most
of
L.J.
Hooker
Corp.
's
real-estate
and
shopping-center
holdings
.

The
consortium
was
put
together
by
Hoare
Govett
,
the
London-based
investment
banking
company
that
is
a
subsidiary
of
Security
Pacific	ARG1
Corp
.

The
sellers
on
Friday
came
from
all
corners
of
the
OTC
market	ARG1
--
big
and
small
institutional
investors
,
as
well
as
individual
investors
and
market
makers
.

But
a
majority
of
the
Addison
council	ARG1
did
n't
buy
those
arguments
.

Now
kindred
spirits
on
Addison
's
town
council
have
barred
the
town
's
fanciest
hotel
,
the
Grand
Kempinski
,
from
installing
three
free
pool
tables
in
its
new
lounge
.

Another
,
``
Jeux
Sans
Frontieres
,
''
where
villagers
from
assorted
European	ARG1
countries
make
fools
of
themselves
performing
pointless
tasks
,
is
a
hit
in
France
.

``
The
Miami
market
is
coming
back
strong
after
a
tough
couple
of
years	ARG1
''
when
Knight-Ridder
``
was
starting
up
a
Hispanic
edition
and
circulation
was
falling
,
''
said
Bruce
Thorp
,
an
analyst
for
Provident
National
Bank
.

Unseasonably
hot
,
dry
weather
across
large
portions
of
the
Great
Plains	ARG1
and
in
wheat-growing
areas
in
Washington
and
Oregon
is
threatening
to
reduce
the
yield
from
this
season
's
winter
wheat
crop
,
said
Conrad
Leslie
,
a
futures
analyst
and
head
of
Leslie
Analytical
in
Chicago
.

Late
Thursday
,
after
the
close
of
trading
,
the
market
received
what
would
normally
have
been
a
bullish
U.S.
Department
of
Agriculture
estimate
of
the
1989-90
Florida
orange
crop
.

Brazilian
juice
,
after
a
delay
caused
by
drought
at
the
start
of
its
crop
season
,
is
beginning
to
arrive
in
the
U.S.
in
large
quantities
.

The
cream
of
the
British
crop
,
the
literary
dramas
that
are
shown
on
U.S.
public
television
as
``
Masterpiece
Theater
,
''
make
up
a
relatively
small
part
of
British
air
time	ARG1
.

Amid
a
crowd
of
crashing
stocks
,
Relational
Technology
Inc.
's
stock
fell
particularly
hard
Friday
,
dropping
23
%
because
its
problems
were
compounded
by
disclosure
of
an
unexpected
loss
for
its
fiscal
first
quarter
.

With
superconcentrates
,
however
,
it
is
n't
always
easy
to
persuade
consumers
that
less
is
more
;
many
people
tend
to
dump
too
much
detergent
into
the
washing
machine
,
believing
that
it
takes
a
cup
of
powder	ARG1
to
really
clean
the
laundry
.

Against
that
backdrop
,
UAW
Vice
President
Stephen
P.
Yokich
,
who
recently
became
head
of
the
union
's
GM
department
,
issued
a
statement
Friday
blasting
GM
's
``
flagrant
insensitivity
''
toward
union
members
.

A
glance
through
the
television
listings
and
a
few
twists
of
the
European
television
dial	ARG1
suggest
one
reason
why
.

RJR
Nabisco
Inc.
is
disbanding
its	ARG1
division
responsible
for
buying
network
advertising
time
,
just
a
month
after
moving
11
of
the
group
's
14
employees
to
New
York
from
Atlanta
.

It
is
bigger
,
faster
and
more
profitable
than
the
news
divisions
of
any
of
the
three
major
broadcast	ARG1
networks
.

British
Aerospace
PLC
and
France
's
Thomson-CSF
S.A.
said
they
are
nearing
an
agreement
to
merge
their	ARG1
guided-missile
divisions
,
greatly
expanding
collaboration
between
the
two
defense
contractors
.

He
has
been
president
and
chief

of
Amperex

But
the
commodity-chemical
producers
are
caught
on
the
downside
of
a
pricing
cycle	ARG1
.

Lawyers
for
dozens
of
insolvent
savings
and
loan
associations	ARG1
are
trying
a
new
tack
in
their
efforts
to
defuse
suits
filed
by

,
developers
and
creditors
.

And
even
if
a
nurse
would
wear
flowers
in
her	ARG1
hair
while
on
duty
,
if
she
were
engaged
she
would
know
to
wear
them
behind
her
left
,
not
right
,
ear
.

Crude
oil
production
may
turn
out
to
be
the
most
surprising
element
of
companies

earnings	ARG1
this
year
.

China
's
Communist
leadership
voted
to
purge
the
party
of
``
hostile
and
anti-party	ARG1
elements
''
and
wealthy
private
businessmen
,
whom
they
called
exploiters
.

Avco

received
an
$
11.8

The
book
loses
some
momentum
toward
the
end
,
when
Lily
becomes
more
preoccupied
with
dating
boys
and
less
with
her
delightfully
weird
family
.

Two-thirds
of
respondents	ARG1
said
they
strongly
felt
the
need
to
be
successful
in
their
jobs
,
while
fewer
than
half
said
they
strongly
felt
the
need
to
spend
more
time
with
their
families
.

Earlier
the
company
announced
it
would
sell
its
aging
fleet
of
Boeing
Co.
707s	ARG1
because
of
increasing
maintenance
costs
.

On
the
exchange	ARG1
floor
,
``
as
soon
as
UAL
stopped
trading
,
we
braced
for
a
panic
,
''
said
one
top
floor
trader
.

He
camped
out
at
a
high-tech
nerve
center
on
the
floor
of
the
Big
Board	ARG1
,
where
he
could
watch
updates
on

Once

Christopher

The

said
any

be
led
by

GM
officials
want
to
get
their
strategy
to
reduce

the
work	ARG1
force
in
place
before

begin

For
the
first
time
,
the
83-year-old
justice
finds
his
influence
almost
exclusively
in
dissent
,
rather
than
as
a
force
in
the
high
court
's
majority	ARG1
.

The
network
's
salaries
have
always
ranged
far
below
industry
standards

resulting

a
less-experienced

Roh

facing
calls
for

proposals
for
a
new

The

Shares
of
UAL	ARG1
,
the
parent
of
United
Airlines
,
were
extremely
active
all
day
Friday
,
reacting
to
news
and
rumors
about
the
proposed
$
6.79
billion
buy-out
of
the
airline
by
an
employee-management	ARG1
group
.

And
10
minutes
after
the
UAL
trading
halt
came
news
that
the
UAL
group
could
n't
get
financing
for
its
bid
.

The
group
is
led
by
Jay
Shidler
,
chief

Corp.
in
Honolulu

and
A.

Major
mutual-fund	ARG1
groups
said
phone
calls
were
arriving
at
twice
the
normal
weekend
pace
yesterday
.

Still
,
fund	ARG1
groups
are
n't
taking
any
chances
.

The
broadcast	ARG1
group
had
been
based
in
New
York
until
a
year
ago
,
when
RJR
's
previous
management
moved
it
to
Atlanta
,
the
company
's
headquarters
before
this
summer
.

But
his
level
of
frustration
showed
in
a
recent
,
impassioned
speech
to
a
group
of
hundreds
of
lawyers	ARG1
in
Chicago
.

Its
watchers
are
,
on
the
whole
,
a
disloyal
group
of
channel-zapping
``
grazers	ARG1
''
and
news
junkies
,
who
spend
an
average
of
just
26
minutes
a
day
watching

according
to
audience

The
number
of
active

in
Canada
is
down
30
%
from
a
year
ago
,
and
the
number
of

Robert

,
manager
of
crude

with
Calgary
's
Independent

industry
group

The
goal
was
to
learn
about

Both

are
dismissed
by
notebook

argue
that
they

a
problem

also
encountered
in

groups

admits
Gerry
Purdy
,
director

.

``
Half
of

really
scared

said
,
``
but
I
'm
trying
to
talk

out
of

That
discrepancy
hurts
Quantum
badly
,
because
its
own
plants
cover
only
about
half
of
its
ethylene
needs	ARG1
.

But
the
full
effect
on
prices
of
the
winter
wheat
now
being
planted
wo
n't
be
felt
until
the
second
half
of
next
year	ARG1
.

Canadian
crude
production	ARG1
averaged
about
1.69
million
barrels
a
day
during
1989	ARG1
's
first
half
,
about
1
%
below
the
1988
level
.

To
illustrate
,
Mr.
Rogers
said
that
of
the
14
computer-related
firms
he
follows
,
half
will
report
for
their
most
recent
quarter
earnings
below
last
year
's
results
,
and
half
above
those
results
.

Searle
continued

Individuals
can
always
have
their	ARG1
hands
slapped

The
Hong

Telecommunications
warrants
should
be
attractive
to
buyers
in
Europe

the
bankers
added
,
because
the

is
one
of
a
handful
of
blue-chip
stocks	ARG1
on
the
Hong
Kong
market
that
has
international
appeal
.

A
handful
of
hot
retail
locations	ARG1
,
such
as
the
57th
Street
and
Madison
and
Fifth
Avenue
areas
,
have
been
able
to
sustain
what
many
see
as
astronomical
rents
.

The
OTC
market
has
only
a
handful
of
takeover-related
stocks	ARG1
.

Several
traders
could
be
seen
shaking
their	ARG1
heads
when
the
news
flashed
.

Lily

The
balance
is
supplied
by
a

such
as

But
his
level
of

Late
Friday
night
,
the

voted
87
-
7
to
approve
an
estimated
$
13.5
billion
measure
that
had
been
stripped
of
hundreds
of
provisions	ARG1
that
would
have
widened
,
rather
than
narrowed
,
the
federal
budget
deficit
.

The
government
sold
the
deposits
of
four
savings-and-loan
institutions
,
in
its
first
wave
of
sales	ARG1
of
big
,
sick
thrifts
,
but
low
bids
prevented
the
sale
of
a
fifth
.

Mr.
Atherton
said
CityFed
will
also
mark
its
portfolio
of
high-yield
corporate
bonds
to
market
as
a
result
of
federal
legislation
requiring
that

divest
themselves
of
such

.

The
charge
on
loans
to

The
collateral
is

,
Union
Carbide
Corp.
and
several
oil
giants
--
have
much
broader
business	ARG1
interests
and
so
are
better
cushioned
against
price
swings
.

Bozell
joins
Backer
Spielvogel
Bates
and
Ogilvy
Group
as
U.S.
agencies
with
interests
in
Korean
agencies	ARG1
.

GM
said
it
still
is
talking
with
Jaguar
about
acquiring
a
minority
interest
.

The
University
is
seeking
to
block
the
acquisition
of
Connaught
by
foreign	ARG1
interests
,
citing
concerns
about
the
amount
of
research
that
would
be
done
in
Canada
.

But
those
machines
are
still
considered
novelties
,
with
keyboards
only
a
munchkin
could
love
and
screens
to
match
.

But
I
am
suggesting
that
they
stop
requiring
Mr.
Mason
to
interrupt
his
classic
shtik
with
some
line
about
``
caring
for
other
people
''
that
would
sound
shmaltzy
on
the
lips
of
Miss
America
.

He
sandwiched
his
praise
of
constitutional
meat
between
large
loaves
of
bilious
commentary	ARG1
.

The
company
will
also
be
producing
a
new
line
of

telephones
,
which

In
the

Bronx
,
Jewish
working-class
people
lived
in
drab
,
Soviet-style
buildings
``
glamorized
''
with
names
like
AnaMor
Towers
(
after
owners
Anna
and
Morris
Snezak
)
,
whose
lobbies
and

were
decorated
with
murals
of
ancient
Syrians
and
Greeks
,
friezes
of
Pompeii
.

And
I
think
a
lot
of
people	ARG1
will
harp
on
program
trading
.

``
Two
years
ago
there
were
massive
redemption
levels
over
the
weekend
and
a
lot
of
fear	ARG1
around
,
''
said
C.
Bruce
Johnstone
,
who
runs
Fidelity
Investments
'
$
5
billion
Equity-Income
Fund
.

Mr.
Stookey
said
of
the
boom
,
``
It	ARG1
's
going
to
last
a
whole
lot
longer	ARG1
than
anybody
thinks
.
''

``
If
we
get
rid
of
a
lot
of
that
nonsense	ARG1
,
it
will
be
a
big
plus
.
''

``
The
explosion
of
junk
bonds
and
takeovers
has
lodged
a
lot
of
insecure
securities	ARG1
in
the
hands
of
investors
and
loaded
the
corporations
that
are
the
objects
of
takeovers
or
feared
takeovers
with
huge
amounts
of
debt
rather
than
equity
.

``
There
was
n't
a
lot
of
volume	ARG1
because
it
was
just
impossible
to
get
stock
moved
,
''
said
E.E.
``
Buzzy

Geduld

president
of
Herzog
,
Heine
,
Geduld
,
a
New

company
that
makes
markets
in
thousands
of
OTC
issues
.

Partly
because
of
concern
about
the
economy
and
partly
because
she
recently
quit
her
job
as
a
legal
assistant
to
go
to
school
,
``
I
think
at
this
point
we
want
to
be
a

more	ARG1
liquid	ARG1
.
''

The
crowded
field
for
notebook-sized
computers
is
about
to
become
a
lot
more	ARG1
crowded
.

``
I
've
had
a
lot
of
people	ARG1
trying
to
sell
me
services
to
find
out
how
big
it
is

''
says
Tom
Humphries
,
director
of
marketing
for
GRiD

``
A
lot
of
pent-up
demand	ARG1
is
gone

The
company
grew
modestly
until
1986
,
when
a
majority
position
in
Hooker	ARG1
Corp.
was
acquired
by
Australian
developer
George
Herscu
,
currently
Hooker
's
chairman
.

Mr.
Herscu
proceeded
to
launch
an
ambitious
,
but
ill-fated
,
$
1
billion
acquisition
binge
that
included
Bonwit
Teller
and
B.
Altman
&
Co.
,
as
well
as
majority
positions
in
Merksamer
Jewelers	ARG1
,
a
Sacramento
chain
;
Sakowitz
Inc.
,
the
Houston-based
retailer
,
and
Parisian
Inc.
,
the
Southeast
department-store
chain
.

For
the
first
time
,
the
83-year-old
justice
finds
his
influence
almost
exclusively
in
dissent
,
rather
than
as
a
force
in
the
high
court
's
majority	ARG1
.

Now
,
however
,
as
the
court
's
new
five-member
conservative	ARG1
majority
continues
to
solidify
,
victories
for
the
liberals
are
rare
.

But
a
majority
of
the
Addison
council	ARG1
did
n't
buy
those
arguments
.

Mr.
Stram
said
Enron
is
considering
building
gas-fired
power
plants
in
the
U.K.
capable
of
producing
about
500
megawatts
of
power	ARG1
at
a
cost
of
about
$
300
million
to
$
400
million
.

Most
of
the
Western
European
members
of
Coordinating
Committee	ARG1
on
Multilateral
Export
Controls
,
the
unofficial
forum
through
which
the
U.S.
and
its
allies
align
their
export-control
policies
,
are
expected
to
argue
for
more
liberal
export
rules
at
a
meeting
to
be
held
in
Paris
Oct.
25
and
26
.

But
the
Bush
administration
says
it
wants
to
see
evidence
that
all
Cocom	ARG1
members
are
complying
fully
with
existing
export-control
procedures
before
it
will
support
further
liberalization
.

That
speculation
abounded
Friday
as
industry
executives
analyzed
the
appointment
of
the
new
chief
executive
,
Robert
Louis-Dreyfus
,
who
joins
Saatchi
and
becomes
a
member
of
its
board	ARG1
on
Jan.
1
.

Robert
G.
Walden
,
62
years
old
,
was
elected
a
director
of
this
provider
of
advanced
technology
systems
and
services
,
increasing
the
board	ARG1
to
eight
members
.

Against
that
backdrop
,
UAW
Vice
President
Stephen
P.
Yokich
,
who
recently
became
head
of
the
union
's
GM
department
,
issued
a
statement
Friday
blasting
GM
's
``
flagrant
insensitivity
''
toward
union
members
.

Dissident
UAW	ARG1
members
have
used
the
Fiero
plant
as
a
symbol
of
labor-management
cooperation
's
failure
.

Mayor
Lynn
Spruill
and
two
members
of
the
council	ARG1
said
they
were
worried
about
setting
a
precedent
that
would
permit
pool
halls
along
Addison
's
main
street
.

And
a
safe
one
--
imagine
if
the
romance
in
question
were
between
an
Orthodox
Jew
and
a
member
of
the
Nation	ARG1
of
Islam
.

When
an
agreement
was
reached
to
strip
capital
gains
from
the
legislation
,
Oregon
Sen.
Bob
Packwood
,
the
ranking
GOP
member
of
the
tax-writing
Senate
Finance
Committee	ARG1
,
hailed
it
.

In
fact
,
some
of
the
association	ARG1
's
members
--
long-term
,
buy-and-hold
investors
--
welcomed
the
drop
in
prices
.

``
We
hope
to
take
advantage
of
it
,
''
said
John
Snyder
,
a
member
of
a
Los
Angeles
investors
'
club	ARG1
.

It
is
also
no
comfort
to
landlords
and
small
New
York
retailers
when
the
future
of
larger
department
stores
,
which
anchor
retail	ARG1
neighborhoods
,
are
in
doubt
.

That
's
less
than
one-third
the
time
that
viewers
watch
the
major
broadcast	ARG1
networks
.

Mr.
Benton
expects
Compaq
to
unveil
a
family
of
high-end
personal
computers	ARG1
later
this
year
that
are
powerful
enough
to
serve
as
the
hub
for
communications
within
large
networks
of
desk-top
machines	ARG1
.

Tandem
makes
``
fault-tolerant
''
computers
--
machines
with
built-in
backup
systems
--
that
run
stock
exchanges
,
networks
of
automatic
tellers	ARG1
and
other
complex
computer
systems	ARG1
.

Its
niche
as
the
``
network
of
record	ARG1
''
during
major
crises
draws
elite
audiences
around
the
world
.

The
agreements
bring
to
a
total
of
nine
the
number
of
planes	ARG1
the
travel
company
has
sold
this
year
as
part
of
a
restructuring	ARG1
.

The
seller
of
photographic
products
and
services
said
it
is
considering
a
number
of
financing
alternatives	ARG1
,
including
seeking
increases
in
its
credit
lines
.

``
It
seems
to
me
that
a
story
like
this
breaks
just
before
every
important
Cocom
meeting
,
''
said
a
Washington
lobbyist
for
a
number
of
U.S.
computer
companies	ARG1
.

In
a
suit
filed
in
federal
court
Thursday
,
the
S&L
alleged
that
a
``
disproportionate
number
''
of
the
bonds	ARG1
it
purchased
in
1984
declined
in
value
.

In
response
to
dwindling
domestic
supplies
,
Agriculture
Secretary
Clayton
Yeutter
last
month
said
the
U.S.
government
would
slightly
increase
the
number
of
acres	ARG1
farmers
can
plant
in
wheat
for
next
year
and
still
qualify
for
federal
support
payments
.

The
company
said
it
planned
to
offer
an
undetermined
number
of
common
shares
in
exchange
for
the
585COMMA000
shares
of
its
preferred
stock
outstanding
.

``
As
businesses
contract
or
depart
,
the
number
of
employees	ARG1
who
might
use
retail
services
shrinks
,
''
says
Edward
A.
Friedman
,
senior
vice
president
of
Helmsley
Spear
Inc
.

But
always
,
in
years
past
,
they
have
bucked
the
trend
and
have
been
able
to
pick
up
a
fifth
vote
to
eke
out
a
number
of
major
victories	ARG1
in
civil
rights
and
liberties
cases
.

The
new
show
is
perhaps
the
boldest
in
a
number
of
steps	ARG1
the
network
is
taking
to
build
audience
loyalty
by
shifting
away
from
its
current
format
toward
more
full-length
``
signature
''
programming
with
recognizable
stars
.

``
We
're
asking
the
court
for
a
number
of
things	ARG1
he
can
grant
in
addition
to
the
thrill
of
victory
,

he
says
.

Hundreds
of
East

The

pointed

is
not
the
likes
of

player

totaled
785

the

To
make
its
point
,
it
is
challenging
the
Italian

to
explain
reports
that
Olivetti

have
supplied
the

with
sophisticated
computer-driven
devices
that

But
Time

the
more
cost-conscious
Time

itself
away

at

Part
of
the

is
the

``

In

,
there
will
be
plenty
of

go
around

The

''
said
William
Randol
,
a

analyst
at
First

Refiners
say
margins
picked
up
in
September
,
and
many
industry
officials
believe
gasoline

The

,
or
$
1.25
a

,
it

Amid
a
crowd
of
crashing
stocks
,
Relational
Technology
Inc.
's
stock
fell
particularly
hard
Friday
,
dropping
23
%
because
its
problems
were
compounded
by
disclosure
of
an
unexpected
loss
for
its
fiscal
first
quarter
.

The

said
it

first

A
third
model
,
marketed
in
Japan
,
may
hit
the
U.S.
by
the
end
of
the
first
quarter
of
1990	ARG1
,
but
by
then
,
analysts
say
,
Compaq
will
have
established
itself
as
one
of
three
major
players
.

Tandem
Computers
Inc.
,
preparing
to
fight
with
International
Business
Machines
Corp.
for
a
piece
of
the
mainframe
business	ARG1
,
said
it
expects
to
post
higher
revenue
and
earnings
for
its
fiscal	ARG1
fourth
quarter
ended
Sept.
30
.

In
the
third
quarter
of
1987	ARG1
,
the
economy
spurted
at
an
inflation-adjusted
annual
rate
of
5.3
%
.

The
consensus
among
economists
is
that
it
grew
a
much
more
sluggish
2.3
%
in
the
third
quarter
of
1989	ARG1
,
which
ended
two
weeks
ago
.

In
the
1988	ARG1
third
quarter
,
the
company
earned
$
461
million
,
or
$
1.91
a
share
,
on
sales
of
$
7.99
billion
.

Once
the
chief
beneficiaries
of
the
industry
's
now
fading
boom
,
these
producers
also
will
be
reporting
against
exceptionally
strong
performances
in
the
1988	ARG1
third
quarter
.

In
the
1988	ARG1
third
quarter
,
Quantum
earned
$
99.8
million
,
or
$
3.92
a
share
,
on
sales
of
$
724.4
million
.

The
U.S.
,
which
is
finalizing
its
steel-import
quotas
,
is
allocating
a
larger
share
of
its
steel
market	ARG1
to
developing
and
newly
industrialized
countries
which
have
relatively
unsubsidized
steel
industries
.

Mexico
,
which
was
one
of
the
first
countries
to
conclude
its
steel
talks
with
the
U.S.
,
virtually
doubled
its
quota
to
0.95
%
of
the
U.S.
steel
market	ARG1
from
0.48
%
under
the
previous
quotas
.

Mexico
,
which
was
one
of
the
first
countries
to
conclude
its
steel
talks
with
the
U.S.
,
virtually
doubled
its
quota
to
0.95
%
of
the
U.S.
steel
market	ARG1
from
0.48
%
under
the
previous
quotas
.

Meanwhile
,
the
U.S.
has
negotiated
a
significant
cut
in
Japan
's
steel
quota
,
and
made
only
a
minor
increase
to
the
steel
allotment
for
the
European
Community
.

The
EC
and
Japan
--
the
U.S.
's
largest
steel
suppliers
--
have
n't
been
filling
their
quotas
to
the
full
extent
.

The
EC
steel
industry
,
which
has
been
coping
with
strong
European
demand
,
has
been
supplying
about
5
%
of
the
U.S.
market	ARG1
compared
with
recent
quotas
of
about
6.7
%
.

Japan
has
been
shipping
steel
to
total
about
4.5
%
of
the
U.S.
market	ARG1
compared
with
a
quota
of
5.9
%
.

In
the
recent
talks
,
the
EC
had
its
quota
increased
about
300COMMA000
tons
,
to
7
%
of
the
U.S.
market	ARG1
from
6.7
%
in
1988
.

But
its
quota	ARG1
has
been
as
high
as
6.9
%
in
1984
.

Japan
,
however
,
has
agreed
to
cut
its
quota	ARG1
to
about
5
%
from
5.9
%
previously
.

Brazil
,
similar
to
Mexico
and
South
Korea
,
is
expected
to
negotiate
a
somewhat
bigger
share
of
the
U.S.
market	ARG1
than
it
had
under
the
previous
five-year
steel
quotas
,
which
expired
Sept.
30
.

The
Bush
administration
earlier
this
year
said
it
would
extend
steel	ARG1
quotas
,
known
as
voluntary
restraint
agreements
,
until
March
31
,
1992
.

As
the
1992
economic
integration
approaches
,
Europe
's
cultural
curators
have
taken
to
the
ramparts
against
American
``
cultural
imperialism
,
''
threatening
to
impose
quotas
against
such
pop
invaders
as
``
Dallas
,
''
``
Miami
Vice
''
and
``
L.A.
Law
.
''

A
raft
of
new
computer
companies	ARG1
also
has
targeted
this
``
server
''
market
.

Though
Boeing
's
stock
price
was
battered
along
with
the
rest
of
the
market	ARG1
Friday
,
it
actually
has
risen
over
the
last
two
weeks
on
the
strength
of
new
orders
.

The
oil
industry
's
middling
profits
could
persist
through
the
rest
of
the
year	ARG1
.

After
a
supply
crunch
caused
prices	ARG1
to
rise
14
%
since
1986
to
$
650
a
metric
ton
,
analysts
are
encouraged
,
because
they
do
n't
expect
a
price
increase
for
the
rest
of
this
year
.

The
statistics
quoted
by
the
``
new
''
Census
Bureau
report
(
garnered
from
1984
to
1986
)
are
out
of
date
,
certainly
as
an
average
for
the
Northeast
,
and
possibly
for
the
rest
of
the
country	ARG1
.

The
market
seems
increasingly
disconnected
from
the
rest
of
the
nation	ARG1
.

In
a
Madrid
hotel
room
recently
,
a
viewer
caught
the
end
of
a
badly
acted
series
about
a
fishing
boat
on
Australia
's
Great
Barrier
Reef
,
only
to
be
urged
by
the
British

to
``
stay

Joseph
Hardiman
,
president
of
the
National
Association
of
Securities
Dealers
,
which
oversees
the
Nasdaq

said
that
despite
the
rush
of
selling	ARG1
,
he
never
considered
the
situation
an
``
emergency
.
''

Stocks
of
utilities	ARG1
held
up
relatively
better
than

At

Harris

8
%
to
10
%
.

General
Motors
Corp.
,
in
a
series
of
moves	ARG1
that
angered
union
officials
in
the
U.S.
and
Canada
,
has
signaled
that
as
many
as
five
North
American
assembly
plants
may
not
survive
the
mid-1990s
as
the
corporation
struggles
to
cut
its
excess
vehicle-making
capacity
.

Compaq
's
series
of
notebooks	ARG1
extends
a
trend
toward
downsizing
in
the
personal
computer

.

Boeing	ARG1

In
the
U.S.
polyethylene
market
,
Quantum	ARG1
has
claimed
the
largest

,
about
20
%
.

In
any
case
,
on
the
day
of
the
meeting
,
Quantum	ARG1
's
shares
slid
$
2.625
to
$
36.625
in
Big

trading
.

The
plant
expansion
should
strengthen
the
company
's
sway
in
the
polyethylene
business
,
where
market	ARG1
share
is
often
taken
through
sheer
capacity
.

The

,
Brazil
is
expected
to
increase
its

had

.

Brazil
,
similar
to
Mexico
and
South

,
is
expected
to
negotiate
a
somewhat
bigger
share
of
the
U.S.
market	ARG1
than
it
had
under
the
previous
five-year
steel
quotas

it

of

also
disclosed

Wall

''
had
placed
unusually
large
bets
that

would
succeed
and
UAL	ARG1

would
rise

Arbitragers

dump
their
UAL	ARG1
stock
--
but
they
rid
themselves
of
nearly
every
``
rumor

be
looking

it

over

on
the
strength

Quantum
described
the

a
way
for

a
crowd
of
crashing

,
Relational
Technology

fell
particularly
hard
Friday
,
dropping

because

indicating
that

heightened

Investors
--
taking
this
as
a
sign
that

slump
was
in

reacted

lost
$

day
to

caused

Stocks

better

sectors
during

But
,
with
profits
sagging
on
Wall

since
the

,
companies
have
kept
smaller

stockpiles
on
hand
.

Mayor
Lynn

and
two
members
of
the
council	ARG1
said
they
were
worried
about
setting
a
precedent
that
would
permit
pool
halls
along
Addison

.

Meanwhile
,
analysts
said
Pfizer
's
recent
string
of
lackluster
quarterly
performances
continued
,
as
earnings	ARG1
in
the
quarter
were
expected
to
decline
by
about
5
%
.

In

reshaped

Of
course
,
Mr.

doth
protest
that

said
Franklin

to
break
major
stories
with
a
large
investigative-reporting	ARG1
team
.

Mr.
Amos
says
the
Shaw-Crier	ARG1
team
will
probably
do
two
live
interviews
a
day
,
with
most
of
the
program
,
at
least
for
now
,
appearing
similar
to
CNN
's
other
newcasts
.

The
S&L
lawyers
were
encouraged
last
month
by
an
appellate-court
ruling
in
two
cases
brought
against
defunct
Sunbelt
Savings
&
Loan
Association
of
Dallas
by
the
developers
of
the
Valley
Ranch
,
best
known
as
the
training
center
for
the
Dallas
Cowboys
football
team
.

Two-thirds
of
respondents	ARG1
said
they
strongly
felt
the
need
to
be
successful
in
their
jobs
,
while
fewer
than
half
said
they
strongly
felt
the
need
to
spend
more
time
with
their
families
.

Although
they
represent
only
2
%
of
the
population	ARG1
,
they
control
nearly
one-third
of
discretionary
income	ARG1
.

Mrs.
Crump
said
no
one
got
discouraged
,
and
we
gained
that
back
--
and
more
.

Thousands
of
supporters	ARG1
,
many
brandishing
flags
of
the
outlawed
African
National
Congress
,
gave
the
anti-apartheid
activists
a
tumultuous
reception
upon
their
return
to
black
townships
across
the
country
.

Thousands
of
residents	ARG1
of
low-lying
areas
were
ordered
to
evacuate
as
the
storm
headed
north
in
the
Gulf
of
Mexico
with
80
mph
winds
.

The
Soviet
Union
reported
that
thousands
of
tons
of
goods	ARG1
needed
to
ease
widespread
shortages
across
the
nation
were
piled
up
at
ports
and
rail
depots
,
and
food
shipments
were
rotting
because
of
a
lack
of
people
and
equipment
to
move
the
cargo
.

``
There
was
n't
a
lot
of
volume	ARG1
because
it
was
just
impossible
to
get
stock
moved
,
''
said
E.E.
``
Buzzy
''
Geduld
,
president
of
Herzog
,
Heine
,
Geduld
,
a
New
York
company
that
makes
markets
in
thousands
of
OTC
issues
.

In
the
recent
talks
,
the
EC
had
its
quota
increased
about
300COMMA000
tons
,
to
7
%
of
the
U.S.
market	ARG1
from
6.7
%
in
1988
.

In
recent
years
,
U.S.
steelmakers
have
supplied
about
80
%
of
the
100
million
tons	ARG1
of
steel
used
annually
by
the
nation
.

The
Soviet
Union
reported
that
thousands
of
tons
of
goods	ARG1
needed
to
ease
widespread
shortages
across
the
nation
were
piled
up

and
rail

,
and
food
shipments
were
rotting
because
of
a
lack
of
people
and
equipment
to
move
the
cargo
.

The
company
said
normal
seasonal
softness
and
lost
orders
caused
by
prolonged
labor
talks
reduced
shipments	ARG1
by
200COMMA000
tons
in
the
latest
quarter
,
compared
with
the
second
quarter
.

So
CNN
,
a
unit
of
Atlanta-based
Turner
Broadcasting
System	ARG1
Inc.
,
is
trying
to
reposition
itself
as
a
primary
channel
,
or
what
people
in
the
television
industry
call
a
``
top
of
mind
''
network
.

Ripples
from
the
strike
by
55COMMA000
Machinists	ARG1
union	ARG1
members
against
Boeing
Co.
reached
air
carriers
Friday
as
America
West
Airlines
announced
it
will
postpone
its
new
service
out
of
Houston
because
of
delays
in
receiving
aircraft
from
the
Seattle
jet
maker
.

General
Motors
Corp.
,
in
a
series
of
moves	ARG1
that
angered
union
officials
in
the
U.S.
and
Canada
,
has
signaled
that
as
many
as
five
North
American
assembly
plants
may
not
survive
the
mid-1990s
as
the
corporation
struggles
to
cut
its
excess
vehicle-making
capacity
.

Against
that
backdrop
,
UAW
Vice
President
Stephen
P.
Yokich
,
who
recently
became
head
of
the
union
's
GM
department
,
issued
a
statement
Friday
blasting
GM
's
``
flagrant
insensitivity
''
toward
union
members
.

GM
is
studying
whether
it
can
build
the
new
Camaro-Firebird
profitably
at
a
plant
in
St.
Therese
,
Quebec
,
company
and
union
officials
said
.

That
announcement
left
union
officials
in
Van
Nuys
and
Oklahoma
City
uncertain
about
their
futures
.

Union
officials
have
taken
a
beating
politically
as
a
result

at

the

not

Senate
Republicans
expressed
the
hope
that
the
House
would
follow
the
lead
of
the
Senate
,
which
on
Friday
agreed
to
drop
a
variety
of
spending
measures	ARG1
and
tax
breaks	ARG1
that
would
have
increased
the
fiscal
1990
deficit
.

Responding
to
that
demand
,
however
,
has
led
to
a
variety
of
compromises	ARG1
.

Nevertheless
,
Tandem
faces
a
variety
of
challenges	ARG1
,
the
biggest
being
that
customers
generally
view
the
company
's
computers
as
complementary
to
IBM
's
mainframes
.

Selling
snowballed
because
of
waves
of
automatic
``
stop-loss
''
orders	ARG1
,
which
are
triggered
by
computer
when
prices
fall
to
certain
levels
.

After
the
trading
halt
in
the
S&P
500
pit
in
Chicago
,
waves
of
selling	ARG1
continued
to
hit
stocks
themselves
on
the
Big
Board
,
and
specialists
continued
to
notch
prices
down
.

As
small
investors
peppered
their
mutual
funds
with
phone
calls
over
the
weekend
,
big
fund
managers
said
they
have
a
strong
defense
against
any
wave
of
withdrawals	ARG1
:
cash
.

Last
summer
was
notable
for
a
heat	ARG1
wave
and
drought
that
caused
utilities
to
burn
more
natural
gas
to
feed
increased
electrical
demand
from
air
conditioning
use
.

The
government
sold
the
deposits
of
four
savings-and-loan
institutions
,
in
its
first
wave
of
sales	ARG1
of
big
,
sick
thrifts
,
but
low
bids
prevented
the
sale
of
a
fifth
.

Not
really
insurance
,
this
tactic
was
designed
to
soften
the
blow
of
declining
stock
prices
and
generate
an
offsetting
profit
by
selling
waves
of
S&P
futures
contracts	ARG1
.

Its
watchers
are
,
on
the
whole
,
a
disloyal
group
of
channel-zapping
``
grazers	ARG1
''
and
news
junkies
,
who
spend
an
average
of
just
26
minutes
a
day
watching
CNN
,
according
to
audience
research
.

A
celebrity

150
